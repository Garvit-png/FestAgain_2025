# üìù YourBlog - Blog Platform (Frontend-Only)

A simple blog platform built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** without any backend.  
All user data (login details and blogs) are stored in **localStorage**, so the app works completely in the browser.

##  Features
-  **User Authentication** (Register & Login using localStorage)  
-  **Create Blogs** with title and content  
-  **View Blogs** in a clean card layout  
-  **Delete Blogs** (only by the owner)  
-  Data persistence using **localStorage**
